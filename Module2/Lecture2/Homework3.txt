First, set x and y to 0 (assuming values are already inputted). Calculate
the ofset in distance (as independant x andy values) for each set of moves
Alice makes from her starting point. Then, check if (by divisibility), by covering this
distance each time, will Alice cross/reach the queen. If yes, cout << "<<YES>>";. Else
cout << "<<NO>>";
